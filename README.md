# OpenGLRenderer
This is a pseudo-engine thingy I made in high school, it contains most of the basics of a game engine such as Unity and Unreal (A render panel, a hierarchy, an inspector, etc..).
It also has an extremely sloppy attempt at reading and writing asset files for the engine, there's a lot of room for improvement.
